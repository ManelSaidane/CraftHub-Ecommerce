CraftHub
Overview
CraftHub is an innovative e-commerce platform tailored for artisans to sell unique handmade products (e.g., pottery, jewelry, textiles, woodworking) and offer creative workshops (online or in-person). It addresses the challenge faced by artisans struggling to digitize their businesses by providing a specialized marketplace with a subscription-based model for artisans. CraftHub integrates AI-driven features to enhance user experience, streamline content management, and boost sales efficiency.
